    <h1>Low and Slow</h1>

    <p>
        This week I am <em>extremely excited</em> about a new cooking technique
        called <em>sous vide</em>. In <em>sous vide</em> cooking, you submerge
        the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is
        precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to.
        In his book, <cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>, Jeff Potter describes it as
        "ultra-low-temperature poaching."

        Next month, we will be serving <strong>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</strong>.
        To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before November 30.

        <strong>Warning:</strong> <em>Sous vide</em> cooked salmon is not pasteurized.
        Avoid it if you are pregnant or have immunity issues.
